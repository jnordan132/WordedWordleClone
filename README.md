## Description

Worded is my version of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). This "clone" was created using Vite's typescript template in React. Every time you refresh the site, a word for that game will be created, you have 6 attempts at solving the 5 letter word. Based on how many times you play the game, you will be given a stats menu that tracks the amount solved and the amount attempted to solve the game. Note: This application includes nearly 13,000 words, therefore, some games may be MUCH harder than others.
